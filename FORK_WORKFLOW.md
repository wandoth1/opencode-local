# Fork Workflow — `opencode-skein`

This is a permanent fork of opencode. It tracks upstream on the `dev` branch and
adds local features (loop/auto-reply/pattern-detection, llama-skein local
provider discovery, context sidebar, etc.) on top.

Two rules keep syncs from being a mess:

1. **The fork's custom surface is inventoried in [`fork/manifest.json`](fork/manifest.json).**
   Nothing custom is "remembered" — it's listed, and `bun run fork:verify` proves
   it survived every sync.
2. **Custom code lives in its own files; shared upstream files get the smallest
   possible patch.** New CLI commands are registered through one array
   (`src/fork/commands.ts` → a single `.command(ForkCommands)` in `index.ts`), so
   upstream can reshuffle its command list without ever conflicting with ours.

## The inventory: `fork/manifest.json`

| Section | Meaning | Verified by |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `owned` | Fork-only files (don't exist upstream). Can't content-conflict, but *can* be dropped during conflict resolution. | must exist |
| `patched` | Upstream files we edit. Each has a `marker` string — the fingerprint of our change. | must exist **and** contain marker |
| `baseline` | The upstream commit our `dev` currently contains. | drives `sync:check` |

`bun run fork:verify` checks all of the above. A `patched` entry with
`"status": "REGRESSED"` is a patch already known to be lost — reported as a
non-blocking warning so you can re-apply it deliberately. Pass `--strict` to fail
on those too.

> **No outstanding regressions as of 2026-08-12.** `fork:verify` is 11/11 owned,
> 18/18 patched. The `theme.tsx` `ThemeState.set` regression noted here since
> 2026-06-18 had already been re-applied; the two `cache_creation_tokens`
> entries were phantom (never a real commit, and OpenAI-compatible/copilot
> APIs don't emit that field) and were dropped from the manifest back on
> 2026-06-18 (commit `0399b97e0d`) — this callout just never caught up. A
> manifest audit the same day also found 11 fork-marked patches
> (`// fork:` comments) and 2 fork-only files that existed in the working tree
> but were never added to the manifest at all; they are now tracked.

When you add a new custom file or patch a new upstream file, **add it to the
manifest in the same commit.** That is the single source of truth; the table that
used to live in this doc was stale (wrong paths after upstream moved the TUI into
`packages/tui/`), which is how features got lost.

## Distribution & the updater (`src/fork/distribution.ts`)

The in-app updater used to resolve "latest version" + "where to install from"
against upstream, so saying "yes" to an update prompt would overwrite the fork
binary with upstream's. All distribution targets now point at the fork:

| Target | Value | Env override |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| install script | `raw.githubusercontent.com/androidand/opencode/dev/install` | `OPENCODE_INSTALL_URL` |
| GitHub releases | `androidand/opencode` | `OPENCODE_RELEASE_REPO` |
| brew tap/formula | `androidand/tap` / `opencode-skein` | `OPENCODE_BREW_TAP` / `OPENCODE_BREW_FORMULA` |
| npm / scoop / choco | `opencode-skein` | `OPENCODE_NPM_PACKAGE` etc. |

`installation/index.ts` is otherwise a near-verbatim copy of upstream — it just
imports `ForkDistribution`. The on-disk binary is still named `opencode` (renaming
the `bin` would break existing installs); collision is avoided by the updater only
ever pulling fork artifacts.

> **Publishing not wired yet.** Upstream's `publish.yml` is gated to
> `github.repository == 'anomalyco/opencode'`, so it does not run on the fork. Until
> a fork release pipeline exists, `opencode upgrade` will find no newer fork release
> and simply no-op — which is the safe outcome (it will not pull upstream).

## "New upstream version" = sync trigger, not an upgrade

The updater's "new version available" signal now refers to **our** releases. The
*upstream* signal is handled separately, on purpose:

```bash
bun run sync:check          # fetch upstream, compare to manifest baseline, report
bun run sync:check --apply  # ...and scaffold the sync worktree if upstream is ahead
```

`sync:check` reads `baseline.upstreamRef` from the manifest, fetches `upstream/dev`,
and tells you exactly how many commits you're behind (with the changelog). It never
merges into `dev` or pushes — it stops at a prepared worktree.

## Sync procedure

1. **Check / scaffold:**
   ```bash
   bun run sync:check            # is a sync due?
   bun run sync-upstream:apply   # or: bun run sync:check --apply
   ```
   Creates a sibling worktree `../opencode-sync-YYYYMMDD` on branch
   `sync/upstream-YYYYMMDD` based on `origin/dev`, and merges `upstream/dev` in.

2. **Resolve conflicts** in the sync worktree. Thanks to the modular layout, most
   conflicts are confined to the `patched` files in the manifest.

3. **Verify nothing was lost:**
   ```bash
   cd ../opencode-sync-YYYYMMDD
   bun install
   (cd packages/opencode && bun typecheck)
   bun run fork:verify          # ← every owned file present + every marker intact
   ```
   If `fork:verify` reports a dropped file or lost marker, re-apply it before
   continuing.

4. **Merge back** into `dev`:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin && git checkout dev
   git merge --no-ff sync/upstream-YYYYMMDD --no-edit
   ```

5. **Update the baseline + tag:**
   ```bash
   # set fork/manifest.json baseline.upstreamRef to the new upstream/dev sha,
   # baseline.forkTag to the tag below, baseline.syncedAt to today
   git commit -am "fork: sync upstream <sha>, bump baseline"
   git tag fork/YYYY-MM-DD.N
   git push origin dev fork/YYYY-MM-DD.N
   ```

6. **Clean up:**
   ```bash
   git worktree remove ../opencode-sync-YYYYMMDD
   ```

## Skein port chain

Keep the dependency chain one-way: `upstream/dev` → fork `dev` → a tagged fork
snapshot (`fork/YYYY-MM-DD.N`) → skein port work based on that tag. Port from
tagged snapshots, not a moving branch, so you can always say exactly which fork
state skein is based on. Record the tag in the skein change notes before starting
Go-side work.

## OpenAPI specs — two separate concerns

- **llama-skein spec** (`~/dev/llama-skein/contracts/llama-skein.openapi.json`) —
  the backend LLM proxy API. Unrelated to opencode's HTTP API; do not align them.
- **opencode spec** (`packages/sdk/openapi.json`) — taken from upstream unchanged;
  we extend it at runtime with `/local/*` routes but never edit the spec file.

## Feature or drift

Every file that differs from the upstream baseline is one of two things, and the
distinction is the whole job during a sync:

- **Feature** — something this fork added for a reason we can name (loop, local
  provider discovery, beads sync, peers tool, fork distribution targets,
  self-healing compaction). It belongs in `fork/manifest.json`, as `owned` if the
  file is ours outright or `patched` (with a marker) if it is an upstream file we
  edit. Registering it is what makes `fork:verify` notice when a merge deletes it.

- **Drift** — a local copy, a compatibility shim, or a stale pattern that exists
  only because upstream moved and we did not follow. It has no defenders. Revert
  it to upstream.

There is no third category. Drift is more dangerous than dead code: it compiles
and runs, so nobody finds it by reading — it surfaces when a sync detonates.

`bun run fork:verify` enforces this. Anything in scope that differs from
`baseline.upstreamRef` and is neither registered nor in `divergence.accepted`
fails the check. `accepted` is a ratchet holding the divergence that already
existed when the gate was added; new files must be classified immediately.
Re-baseline deliberately, never reflexively:

    bun run fork:verify --accept-divergence

The gate exists because of a real loss: the 0d927ba03f merge returned
`session/compaction.ts` byte-identical to upstream, silently deleting the fork's
self-healing overflow recovery. Nothing caught it — the feature was not in the
manifest — and it was only found because a fork-only test that had never been
able to run finally ran and asserted the missing behaviour.

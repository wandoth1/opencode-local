/**
 * fork-verify — prove the fork's custom surface survived an upstream sync.
 *
 * Reads fork/manifest.json and checks that:
 *   - every `owned` file (fork-only, can't content-conflict but CAN be dropped
 *     during conflict resolution) still exists, and
 *   - every `patched` upstream file still exists AND still contains its marker
 *     string (the fingerprint of our edit).
 *
 * This is the safety net for the exact failure the fork keeps hitting: a patch
 * silently disappearing in a merge. Run it after every sync, before merging the
 * sync branch back into dev.
 *
 *   bun run fork:verify
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 = clean, 1 = a regression was introduced (or a known
 * regression is still outstanding when --strict is passed).

// the self-healing compaction feature was silently deleted by a merge and went

//
// This is a ratchet, not a wall: the divergence that existed when the gate was
// added is recorded in `divergence.accepted`, and anything NEW fails. Re-baseline
// deliberately with `bun run fork:verify --accept-divergence` once you have
// classified the new files as feature (add to owned/patched) or drift (revert).

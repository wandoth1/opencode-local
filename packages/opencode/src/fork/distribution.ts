/**
 * Fork distribution identity.
 *
 * Upstream's in-app updater resolves "the latest version" and "where to install
 * it from" against opencode.ai / the official npm + brew packages. On a fork
 * that means the updater will happily overwrite YOUR binary with upstream's the
 * next time the user says "yes" to an update prompt.
 *
 * Everything the updater needs to point at the fork instead lives here, in one
 * place, so `installation/index.ts` stays a near-verbatim copy of upstream and
 * the merge conflict surface is a single import. Each value is env-overridable
 * so CI / alternate channels can repoint without a rebuild.
 *
 * Fork identity: `opencode-skein`.
